# FixUserShellFolderPermissions.ps1 - by nicolas.dietrich@microsoft.com - 20221028
#
# Microsoft Customer Support and Services Helper Script
# Checks 'User Shell Folders' registry ACLs, if All Application Packages isn't granted then restore the inheritance, and registers app packages
# Does not require Admin rights, need to be run from the affected user context thus non-elevated
#
# Usage:
#  1) To fix permissions if needed, and then register required packages if permissions were modified:
#    .\FixUserShellFolderPermissions.ps1 
#  2) To fix permissions if needed, and then always register only required or missing packages:
#    .\FixUserShellFolderPermissions.ps1 -register
#  3) To fix permissions if needed, and then force registering every packages (might take long time):
#    .\FixUserShellFolderPermissions.ps1 -force
#
# This script is provided AS IS, no support nor warranty of any kind is provided for its usage.
